# Roadmap and Backlog Themes

This roadmap captures strategic themes, not a date-locked commitment plan.

## Near-Term Themes

- Strengthen security regression coverage in high-risk script paths.
- Improve cross-skill workflow consistency and artifact handoff.
- Expand validation automation for docs/schema drift.

## Mid-Term Themes

- Improve discoverability of skill capabilities and boundaries.
- Add maintainability tooling for shared references and defaults.
- Standardize quality gates for complex workflow changes.

## Long-Term Themes

- Maturity model for skill lifecycle (incubate → stable → deprecated).
- Better operational telemetry around workflow success/failure signals.
- Contributor onboarding automation for faster first PRs.

## Backlog Management Guidance

Prioritize work by:

1. Security impact
2. User-facing reliability impact
3. Contributor productivity impact
4. Documentation/maintainability debt

## How to Propose Roadmap Items

Open an issue with:

- desired outcome
- affected skills/components
- risk and dependency notes
- suggested validation plan
